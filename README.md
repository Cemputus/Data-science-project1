# Data-science-project
# Challenge 1

# Background
You're applying for a summer internship at a national museum for natural history. The museum recently created a database containing all dinosaur records of past field campaigns. Your job is to dive into the fossil records to find some interesting insights, and advise the museum on the quality of the data.

# Challenge 1 Qns.
Help your colleagues at the museum to gain insights on the fossil record data. Include:

How many different dinosaur names are present in the data?
Which was the largest dinosaur? What about missing data in the dataset?
What dinosaur type has the most occurrences in this dataset? Create a visualization (table, bar chart, or equivalent) to display the number of dinosaurs per type. Use the AI assistant to tweak your visualization (colors, labels, title...).
Did dinosaurs get bigger over time? Show the relation between the dinosaur length and their age to illustrate this.
Use the AI assitant to create an interactive map showing each record.
Any other insights you found during your analysis?

# Challenge 2
2Ô∏è‚É£ Part 2 - Understanding movie data üé•

# Background
You have just been hired by a large movie studio to perform data analysis. Your manager, an executive at the company, wants to make new movies that "recapture the magic of old Hollywood." So you've decided to look at the most successful films that came out before Titanic in 1997 to identify patterns and help generate ideas that could turn into future successful films.

# Challenge 2 Qns.
Help your team leader understand the data that's available in the cinema.films dataset. Include:

How many movies are present in the database?
There seems to be a lot of missing data in the gross and budget columns. How many rows have missing data? What would you recommend your manager to do with these rows?
How many different certifications or ratings are present in the database?
What are the top five countries in terms of number of movies produced?
What is the average duration of English versus French movies? (Don't forget you can use the AI assistant!)
Any other insights you found during your analysis?
